# Button

Using a single button, this code can create mutliple options based on how long and how many times it is pressed

This code is meant to be used with an AR-200R audio recorder. This code is able to play preset phrases on the AR-200R when set to binary mode and when ran by an arduino with 8 relays set up to send ground voltage to corresponding pins in the back of the AR-200R.


   Note 1: On most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board attached to pin 13. 
   Note 2: In this circuit, when the button is pressed, Ground Voltage is what will be applied.
